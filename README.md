# CHEATING DETECTION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

In nowadays cheating has become more advanced especially in the school environment  exploiting new technologies such as wireless headphones, smartphones etc.
Not to forget  that monitoring students for the full test duration can be more than troublesome and tiring for teachers and faculties staff which leads to people abusing the system 
to pass  tests without doing the hard work like other students which is unfair and absurd.


Therefore, our salvation lies in the exploitation of such technologies like Real-time object detection systems such as YOLO that notices important objects
when they appear in an image are widely used for video surveillance of crowds and 
are  important for mobile robots including self-driving cars 
Modeling and developing of a system that exploits modern computer vision technologies (object detection,facial
recognition) to minimze cheating during test sessions
technologies used :pytorch-opencv-Yolov5-streamlit-Dlib-CUDA-CUDNNPython-Scrum

The general idea of the project is to create a system capable of monitoring students  during test sessions 
by identifying tables, students, phones and pinpoint their exact  coordinates and notify the administration about possible cheating attempts 
(using a  phone during a test session or a student not sitting in his rightful place).
Finally, create  test sessions
